                        <hr>
                      <p >Catching almost everyone by surprise, the Pokemon Company announced that there will be two more Pokemon games released in the latter half of this year going by the name of Pokemon Scarlet and Pokemon Violet. With these open-world games, generation nine of Pokemon will officially debut.
                        </p>
                        <p >Announced during the recent Pokemon Day 2022’s special Pokemon Presents, the two new titles developed by Game Freak will showcase a brand new region and a brand new generation of Pokemon, although to this point we’ve only gotten a glimpse at the three starters that will be available. At the start of the game you’ll have the choice to select between Quaxly the water type, Sprigatito the grass type and Fuecoco the fire type.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The games have been stated to be an “evolutionary” step for the franchise as a whole, as the game is planned to feature an “open world where various towns with no borders blend seamlessly into the wilderness.” The Pokemon Company also went on to state that “Pokemon can be seen everywhere in this wide-open world — in the skies, in the sea, and on the streets.” This is a great confirmation as it means the ever building vivid worlds that we’ve seen over Pokemon Sword & Shield, as well as Legends: Arceus, will remain present within these two new additions to the series.</p>
                            <p>
                                We haven’t been given descriptions yet in regards to what the differences will be between the two separate versions, as we normally see different legendaries and game exclusive Pokemon. Currently what we do know is that your character will “have a different outfit depending on which game they are playing.”
                            </p>
                            <p>With Pokemon Legends: Arceus having just been released, hearing that there would be two brand new titles coming at the end of this year almost seems too good to be true. Whilst the games are a great piece of news, fans were quick to point out that the graphics were choppy at times with moments seeming like they could even be from the 3DS… This, however, will more than likely be refined before the release at the end of the year (we can hope.)</p>
