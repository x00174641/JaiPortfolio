                        <hr>
                      <p >Ubisoft has made the announcement that the season of this year for Rainbow Six Siege will also come with a new map. The maps name is Emerald Plans and with this introduction, we will see the first map addition since 2019, which introduced a map named Outback. As well as this, a new defender, Azami, will be introduced to the game. With their ability being that they can patch up surfaces that have been destroyed using a special bulletproof chemical compound.
                        </p>
                        <p >2022 marks the seventh year of Rainbow Six Siege’s content with the new operation Demon Veil. The new map Emerald Plains won’t be available for players until the middle point of the season, unfortunately.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Emerald Plains is a country club/manor house that has a variety of decor within, ranging by floor. The lower floors of the map feature a design that you’d expect from any sort of modern establishment of the type, whilst the upper floors are much more traditionally designed. Whilst we haven’t really seen a proper look at the map for players to be able to tell how well it will play competitively, the fans have received it pretty well, with the positive comments outweighing the guaranteed negative ones.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            The new character Azami will be available from the start of the season, she comes from the world of private security forces within Japan. Her ability to fix the walls, floors, and ceilings using her bulletproof discs that are named Kiba Barriers. The way you deploy this ability is pretty cool, Azami will launch throwing knives at your target that spray out a foam that expands and hardens creating a bulletproof structure. This ability gives the option for defenders to patch up and better defend their structure from range. This will be game-changing for when the defenders need to protect themselves from above, as prior to this it was a tricky task to survive shots from above.</p>
                            <p>
                                The barriers can be attached to any surface in-game, which means you can even cover up windows or doors, this can, however, be countered with explosives, so that should also be kept in mind when trying to hold down a site.
                            </p>
                            <p>Aside from the brand new operator and map, Operation Demon Veil will also add a range of important new gameplay features and changes. One of the new features added that’s caused the most talk from the community is the ability for Attacker Repick, this allows the attacking team to change their selected loadout and operator during the preparation phase of each round. This will create a whole new way to play the game with the dynamic of the match-changing every round depending on how the attackers want to play.</p>
                            <p>Team Deathmatch will also see its introduction into the game, aimed to provide a more casual experience in comparison to the normally hardcore game modes seen within Six Siege. The match will only last for 5 minutes, or until a team reaches 75 kills. The mode will likely see a large userbase due to it being an effective mode to warm up players aim before jumping straight into the unforgiving regular modes within the game.</p>
