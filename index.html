        <hr>
        <p>I'm currently 22 years old with just over 2 years of experience as a Web Content Administrator for Fruitlab Media Limited, where I picked up just over a year and a half's worth of experience writing about current gaming news for both sponsored and non sponsored companies and titles. 
          Alongside this I've been creating live databases to track and monitor the engagement levels of popular content creators as well as compiling their account networks in order to move forwards with incredibly successful ad campaigns with high clickthrough rates.
        </p>
        <p> During my Spare time I Moderate For Psyonix, a studio within Epic Games on a forum with 1.1 million active members, whenever I'm not doing that you'll catch me practising and competing at Rocket League, where I've competed online and at Lan events and currently sit within the top 0.01% of all players globally.</p>

                    <p >I currently Moderate the r/rocketleague subreddit for Psyonix, (a studio that is currently owned by Epic Games) where the current active userbase sits at just over 1.1 million users. Moderation on the subreddit involves tasks such as cyber safety in which our goal is to create a safe online space where people can speak their mind, but also feel safe from discriminatory attacks and other hurtful experiences of which they may find elsewhere online. Alongside this I've also written and published posts as an official standpoint for the company detailing new updates to the game as well as community feedback forms allowing Psyonix to further align themselves with the player base's wants and needs.</p>
