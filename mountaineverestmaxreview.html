                      <hr>
                      <p >Recently we’ve been lucky enough to receive an Everest Max Mechanical Keyboard from the amazing people over at Mountain. After using the keyboard for around a week, it’s safe to say that I’m never changing back. With top of the range aluminium that’s been finished beautifully to create the body of the keyboard, paired with hot-swappable Cherry Red switches and a whole range of features to boot, this is the ultimate mechanical keyboard on the market currently, without a shadow of a doubt.
                        </p>
                        <p >Weighing in at €249,99 The keyboard is certainly a pricey one, why you might ask? Keep reading to find out just why this keyboard is without a doubt worthy of this price tag.
                          </p>
                          <p> For those of you who’ve not heard of Mountain yet, that’s totally ok (it won’t be long till they’re everywhere though.) Around a year ago, they sent us the game-changing MAKALU 67 which you can check out our review for by clicking this link. Mountain is a fairly new contender within the PC peripherals scene as they only started out a few years ago, with their first entry into the scene being a modular keyboard, the Everest. This keyboard was put up for crowdfunding and was incredibly well received by potential buyers as the style wasn’t something that the market had seen a whole lot of yet. So hearing that the Everest Max was soon to hit the market, got our mouths watering when the news first made its way onto our feeds.</p>
                          <p>Mountain offers a whole range of the Everest Keyboard, with the unit we were sent to test out being the ultimate version: The Everest Max. This version of the keyboard comes with all the goodies, the media dock and Numpad with customisable display keys alongside the keyboard itself! If these features seem to be a little too much for you, the Everest Core may be your best bet, although we aren’t here to speak about that today!</p>
                          <p><h1><span>Unboxing and initial thoughts</span></h1>The box that the Mountain Everest Max comes in shouts high quality from the start, the box itself is made of cardboard with minimal design on the outside other than Mountain’s logo as well their tagline “Reach your summit” printed on the top to remain minimalistic. The box is held with a hidden magnet that means you don’t have to fiddle around with any pull tabs which at times can be extremely frustrating, thankfully this wasn’t the case here. The box and packaging itself also end up providing an extremely high degree of protection whilst in transit that at times you simply don’t see from other companies. Each individual component of the keyboard comes within its own cardboard box which adds extra protection and protects the units from scratching and coming into contact during postage. The aesthetic nature is on full show here too as all of these components slot in directly below where the keyboard is housed.</p>
                          <p>The keyboard that we were sent to test was the Everest Max instead of one of the versions without the extra features, this meant that it included a range of extra features. The Numpad and the Media dock and wrist rest attach to the keyboard to create the Everest Max. Alongside the two main extra features, within the box, you can also find adjustment feet for the keyboard, a guide, stickers, a normal Esc keycap in case you don’t want to use the branded one which comes on the keyboard, five testing switches and a USB cable. The included USB cable can be attached to an also included Type-C adapter, allowing you to plug the keyboard right into a Type-C port should your PC have one.</p>
                          <p>The magnetic wrist rest attaches to the keyboard incredibly easily and provides a solid degree of comfort whilst typing or simply browsing the internet. The only issue which I’ve found with this, however, is that the magnetic connection is quite weak after initially attaching on, this meant that whilst I’ve been typing I’ve noticed a decent amount of movement. This might not be an issue for people who don’t apply much pressure whilst typing at their desk, however, personally, it was enough for me to not keep it attached. If the movement isn’t something you notice often then this will be no issue whatsoever for you whilst in use.</p>
                            <p><h1><span>The Keyboard</span></h1>The keyboard itself has many similarities to other tenkeyless mechanical keyboards that are available for purchase currently, so without the logo at the top of the board as well as the branded Esc keycap, it may be difficult to initially identify and differentiate this from other options that are out there.</p>
                            <p>The exact unit we were sent to test, was using the UK layout with Cherry Red switches. The keycaps are made from ABS and feel really great to type on, the switches come pre-lubed, so you know that you’re in for a premium typing experience and this is exactly what you get. This keyboard is without a doubt the best typing experience for both feel and sound that I’ve ever experienced within a mechanical keyboard.</p>
                            <p>The keyboard is made out of aluminium, with the finish being a brushed effect that looks incredibly clean and really helps the keyboard to stand out as the effect is quite an eye-catching design to look at.</p>
                            <p>The palm rest matches the keyboard and when attached looks like it comes as a combined unit, once you’ve attached all of the modular units (which can be installed on either side of the keyboard) the keyboard enters its own world and can be seen just why this is the pinnacle of its class. The Numpad features four separate mini-screens above the Numpad, which allows for customisable display keys allowing for a range of macro buttons. The media dock features media control buttons and an LCD screen with a rotating dial around it, allowing you to change certain settings and set timers, view your PC’s performance and more. The four display screens on the top section of the Numpad can be customised as wanted by the user and so can the LCD dial found on the Media Dock with custom images of your choosing. The modular elements of the keyboard really level up the whole experience into one that’s incredibly advanced.</p>
                            <p>Underneath the keyboard itself, you can find the anti-slip strips as well as the feet of the keyboard, which help to keep the keyboard in place whilst in use, so far I’ve not seen any movement, no matter how vigorously I typed. Also on the bottom of the keyboard is an incredibly helpful cable channel that routes off to any side of the keyboard that you choose, allowing for more efficient cable management no matter what sort of setup you have going.</p>
                            <p>The switches themselves on the keyboard on the specific unit we were sent were the Cherry MX Red which I’m personally used to using, although let me tell you, having the switches pre-lubed makes a world of difference with the whole experience being superior to my previous Cherry MX Red board. Mountain also has Cherry MX Red, Blue, or Brown switches as separate variants of the Everest Max. If you change your mind upon receiving the unit, however, the Everest Max features hot-swappable switches, so you could use any variant of switches for individual keys over the keyboard.</p>
                            <p>The RGB lighting for the keyboard is without a doubt some of the best that I’ve seen within the mechanical keyboard market, it’s not too bright yet it’s incredibly vivid creating a stunning look when I combined it with some double shot PBT keycaps which I already owned. The middle section of the keyboard also features RGB all the way around, which just elevates the RGB experience onto another level, the dark metal of the keyboard really helps the light to pop and stand out perfectly complimenting the sleek brushed design.</p>
                            <p><h1><span>Overview</span></h1>
                              After using the keyboard for around a week, I’ve found after a range of uses such as typing, gaming, and simple internet browsing. I can now say that it’s been the most premium typing experience that I’ve personally experienced. As I mentioned previously, the addition of pre-lubed switched make a world of difference in typing experience, the noise is audibly more satisfying whilst the click is also high quality and linear as it should be. The way the keyboard is laid out meant that I took a little while getting used to it, previously only having used tenkeyless models of various mechanical keyboards. This learning curve was quickly passed, however, with the experience on the other side being worth the time taken to learn. The only particular complaint I found was the wrist rest being particularly weak in regards to how much it would move around whilst typing depending on where the most pressure was going, this resulted in at times a cheap feeling. This was completely rectified however by simply not using the included wrist rest.
                            </p>
                            <p>For anyone who takes pride in their keyboard gaming, the Everest Max is without a doubt going to be the go-to as the switches allow for comfortable typing and inputs over any length of gaming session. If you’re someone who likes to play with a more tactile setup, removing the Numpad and media dock couldn’t be easier, taking under 10 seconds to have both removed and moved away until they need to once again be attached. The quick and simple to use Basecamp software allows you to change quite literally any button on your keyboard into what you desire, with macros for certain PC features being incredibly easy to install for ease of use.</p>
                            <p>The design of the keyboard was clearly one of the main focus points that Mountain set out to put emphasis on when creating, this can be seen within the premium materials, design and assembly that went into creating this keyboard. From the stunning finish all the way over to the incredibly sturdy design, despite having modular elements. The keyboard stands strong regardless of what use you’re planning to put it through. The switches themselves can even be changed, meaning that even if you were to somehow break a few keys, you’ll have no trouble getting the unit up and running again. Care should be taken to not scratch the media dock dial, however, this is more than likely something that goes without saying when it comes to a screen. A little common sense will take you a long way.</p>
                            <p><h1><span>Final Thoughts</span></h1> The Mountain Everest Max is without a doubt, go big or go home and this was done tremendously well, for their first attempt at something like this. Mountain smashed it out of the park. The keyboard succeeds in appealing to both hardcore keyboard enthusiasts as well as PC gaming newbies. If you can stomach the price tag, this is without a doubt the keyboard you should pick up…</p>
